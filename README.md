# unit-4-game

Simple Game that allows user to select a super Hero and Villian. 

Both the selected character's compete with each other based on the user's button click.

The characters in the game have properties stored in an obect. The key properties are attack power, health, Damage and Base Attack power(Hero's Only).

The game has lot of potential to be improvised since it has been modularized with functions.

The Villain's in the play are created dynamically, on further improvisation - hero's can also be created dyanamically.
